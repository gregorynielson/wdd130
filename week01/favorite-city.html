        Los Angeles, California
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love Los Angeles because of the year round amazing weather. It is always sunny, with bright blue skies.

        There are so many fun things to do in Los Angeles. Activities range from a hike in the mountains to swimming in
        the ocean.
        You can even do both in the same day if you wanted to!
